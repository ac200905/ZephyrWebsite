### Programming

#### Adrian Carter

I'm a second year BSc Computing for Games student and I created the initial first person teleportation prototype we chose to base our game off of, therefore I worked mainly on refining the player's teleportation abilities. The most challenging being the long range teleport. I created several other small mechanics such as various traps and hazards. I was also largely responsible for implementing the audio and hand animations towards the end of development. There are a few mechanics I made during development that didn't make it into the final game, including several iterations of a mana system for the teleportation abilities.

I also worked on some non-programming aspects of the game, including creating particle effects for the Updraft and Tornado prefabs and designing and creating experimental levels.

These are the main elements I am responsible for:
- Teleportation Ability
- Blink Ability
- Moving Platforms
- Spike Trap
- Dart Trap
- Jump Pad
- Implementation of Audio
- Implementation of Hand Animations

#### Sam Auber

I'm a second year BSc Computing for Games student and I primarily worked on the core gameloop of Zephyr, the player controller, the end boss and the UI and UX of the game. The most challenging thing I worked on was probably the Game Manager as it sets up the rules of the game and allows for the gameloop to work for each level.

I also worked on some shader programing for the grass and butterfilies in the game and I also made a cool corruption shader for the End Boss that unfortunatley didn't make it into the final game.

And for the majority of the project I had the role of Scrum Master to help oragnise the tasks and workload for each team member and give a clear goal and focus for each sprint.

These are the main elements of the game I am responsible for:
- Rigidbody Charachter Controller
- Game Manager
- UI menus
- Level Select
- Scoreboard
- Grass Shader
- Butterflies shader
- End Boss
