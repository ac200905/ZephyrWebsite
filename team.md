### Programming

#### Adrian Carter

I'm a second year BSc Computing for Games student and I created the initial first person teleportation prototype we chose to base our game off of, therefore I worked mainly on refining the player's teleportation abilities. The most challenging being the long range teleport. I created several other small mechanics such as various traps and hazards. I was also largely responsible for implementing the audio and hand animations towards the end of development. There are a few mechanics I made during development that didn't make it into the final game, including several iterations of a mana system for the teleportation abilities.

I also worked on some non-programming aspects of the game, including creating particle effects for the Updraft and Tornado prefabs and designing and creating experimental levels.

These are the main elements I am responsible for:
- Teleportation Ability
- Blink Ability
- Moving Platforms
- Spike Trap
- Dart Trap
- Jump Pad
- Implementation of Audio
- Implementation of Hand Animations

#### Sam Auber

I'm a second year BSc Computing for Games student and I primarily worked on the core gameloop of Zephyr, the player controller, the end boss and the UI and UX of the game. The most challenging thing I worked on was probably the Game Manager as it sets up the rules of the game and allows for the gameloop to work for each level.

I also worked on some shader programing for the grass and butterfilies in the game and I also made a cool corruption shader for the End Boss that unfortunatley didn't make it into the final game.

And for the majority of the project I had the role of Scrum Master to help oragnise the tasks and workload for each team member and give a clear goal and focus for each sprint.

These are the main elements of the game I am responsible for:
- Rigidbody Charachter Controller
- Game Manager
- UI menus
- Level Select
- Scoreboard
- Grass Shader
- Butterflies shader
- End Boss


#### Arturs Zingis

I am also a second year BsC Computing For Games programming student and I primarily worked on implementing the traps for the game, such as:
- Falling Plaftorm
- Spike Trap
- Dart Trap

And other game elements such as:
- UI (Credits/Settings screens)
- Floater script.

Whilst also assisting with the development of the:
- Moving Platforms

During the course of this project, I was responsible for a lot of the early testing on the trap features but in the end, the tasks that I was responsible for ended up being taken over due to my own attendance issues. This largely impacted my work on the project due to the way it was handled but I could have done more to impact the outcome earlier on in the development cycle. 

This project was a learning experinece for me and although we had our own attendance issues with other members of the team, it was still very enjoyable to get to know everybody and work on something together.
